Borough / District/Town of London a great place to live.There are 32 London boroughs within Greater
London, and each borough has its own governing council. As you can guess, some of
them are more desirable to live in and will reflect that desirability in a greater rise in
housing prices.
    In this Case study I am trying to evaluate which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices over
the (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset.
    I used the data from  this given link https://data.london.gov.uk/download/uk-house-price-index/70ac0766-8902-4eb5-aab5-01951aaed773/UK%20House%20price%20index.xls
